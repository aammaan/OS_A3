# Shell Commands Implementation in C

## Overview
This project implements fundamental shell commands in C, providing a foundational understanding of system-level programming and command-line interfaces, alongside various assignments related to operating systems. The implementation covers essential commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, and more, designed to mimic their Unix counterparts.

## Features
- **Command Implementation**: Includes basic commands such as `ls` (list directory contents), `cd` (change directory), `mkdir` (make directory), `rm` (remove file or directory), and others.
- **Functionality**: Each command is implemented with considerations for error handling, input validation, and system calls where necessary, ensuring robust performance.
- **Educational Purpose**: Designed for educational purposes to grasp system-level programming concepts and command-line interface operations.
